# Computer Vision Lab Assignments - Python Solutions (ENGN6528)

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the Computer Vision assignments for ENGN6528. The lab work involves implementing various computer vision algorithms in Python and analyzing the results.

Each assignment is self-contained and includes code, results, images, and detailed reports explaining all outputs. The assignments are structured as follows:

#### Lab 1: Python Warm-up

- A series of basic Python operations and their interpretations.
- Focuses on fundamental concepts like array creation, slicing, random number generation, and element-wise operations.
- Implements and explains NumPy (or MATLAB) operations such as arrays, linear space, broadcasting, and conditional operations.

#### Lab 2: [Future Assignment Name]

[Add details for your second assignment here].

[Describe the problem statement, the approach you took, any specific techniques used like image processing, feature extraction, or machine learning].

#### Lab 3: [Future Assignment Name]

[Add details for your third assignment here].

[Provide a short summary of the problem, the approach, and techniques used].

## Requirements

To run these assignments, you will need the following:
- Python (v3.x recommended)

For Python users, install the required libraries using:
