# Computer Vision Lab Assignments - Python Solutions (ENGN6528)

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various Computer Vision Lab assignments as part of ANU's ENGN6528 (attempted by me) that focus on Python programming and computer vision concepts. The assignments cover a variety of fundamental techniques and challenges in computer vision, mathematical operations, and numerical analysis using libraries like NumPy and OpenCV (for Python).

Each assignment is self-contained and includes detailed explanations, code, and output. The assignments are structured as follows:

#### Lab 1: Python Warm-up

- A series of basic Python operations and their interpretations.
- Focuses on fundamental concepts like array creation, slicing, random number generation, and element-wise operations.
- Implements and explains NumPy (or MATLAB) operations such as arrays, linear space, broadcasting, and conditional operations.

#### Lab 2: [Future Assignment Name]

[Add details for your second assignment here].

[Describe the problem statement, the approach you took, any specific techniques used like image processing, feature extraction, or machine learning].

#### Lab 3: [Future Assignment Name]

[Add details for your third assignment here].

[Provide a short summary of the problem, the approach, and techniques used].

## Requirements

To run these assignments, you will need the following:
- Python (v3.x recommended)

For Python users, install the required libraries using:
```pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib```
